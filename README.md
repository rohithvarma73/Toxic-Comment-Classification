 **"Toxic Comment Classification using Machine Learning and NLP Techniques"**:
---
This project focuses on classifying toxic comments using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to identify and categorize harmful or offensive content from text data, helping to create safer online communities.

### üìå Features:
- Preprocessing of text data (removal of stop words, stemming, tokenization)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
- Multi-label classification for different types of toxicity (toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate)
- Implementation of various ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### üß† Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML5/CSS3


### üìÅ Dataset:
Used the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) from Kaggle, which contains Wikipedia comments labeled for different types of toxicity.

### üéØ Goal:
To build a robust and accurate classification model that can detect toxic behavior in text data, providing a foundation for real-world moderation tools.
